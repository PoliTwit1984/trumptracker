# Backend Architecture

The backend follows a modular service-oriented architecture designed for maintainability, testability, and scalability.

## Core Services

### config.py
- Environment variable management
- FRED API series configurations
- Historical data settings

### data_fetcher.py (13.22% test coverage)
- Historical data fetching
- Daily updates
- Data formatting and processing
- Comprehensive error handling
- FRED API integration
- Database operations

### data_analyzer.py (15.18% test coverage)
- Claude AI integration
- Trend analysis
- Economic insights generation
- Error handling and validation
- AI prompt management
- Response validation

### inflation_tracker.py
- Service orchestration
- API response formatting
- Status tracking and updates
- Service initialization
- Data validation
- Error handling

## Support Modules

### exceptions.py
Custom exception definitions for better error handling:
- TrackerError (base exception)
- ServiceInitializationError
- DataProcessingError
- BackupError
- ValidationError
- PromptError
- APIError

### decorators.py (81.82% test coverage)
Utility decorators for enhanced functionality:
- retry_on_failure (exponential backoff)
- Error logging and handling
- Function wrapping utilities
- Retry mechanism configuration

### validators.py (86.84% test coverage)
Data validation functions for data integrity:
- Service validation
- Response format validation
- Type checking and verification
- Input validation
- Data structure validation

## Testing Infrastructure
- Comprehensive test suite using pytest
- Test coverage reporting and monitoring
- Mock objects for external services
- Integration tests for service interactions
- Current overall coverage: 34.97% (target: 80%)
- Two modules exceeding coverage target:
  * decorators.py: 81.82%
  * validators.py: 86.84%
- Active work on improving test coverage

## Database Layer
- SQLite database for data storage
- SQLAlchemy ORM for database operations
- Migration support
- Backup functionality
- Data integrity checks
- Connection management

## API Layer
- Flask-based RESTful API
- CORS support
- Error handling middleware
- Request validation
- Response formatting
- Status monitoring
