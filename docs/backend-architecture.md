# Backend Architecture

The backend follows a modular service-oriented architecture:

## Core Services

### config.py
- Environment variable management
- FRED API series configurations
- Historical data settings

### data_fetcher.py (13.22% test coverage)
- Historical data fetching
- Daily updates
- Data formatting and processing
- Comprehensive error handling

### data_analyzer.py (15.18% test coverage)
- Claude AI integration
- Trend analysis
- Economic insights generation
- Error handling and validation

### inflation_tracker.py (26.71% test coverage)
- Service orchestration
- API response formatting
- Status tracking and updates
- Service initialization

## Support Modules

### exceptions.py
Custom exception definitions:
- TrackerError (base exception)
- ServiceInitializationError
- DataProcessingError
- BackupError

### decorators.py
Utility decorators:
- retry_on_failure (exponential backoff)
- Error logging and handling
- Function wrapping utilities

### validators.py
Data validation functions:
- Service validation
- Response format validation
- Type checking and verification

## Testing Infrastructure
- Comprehensive test suite using pytest
- Test coverage reporting and monitoring
- Mock objects for external services
- Integration tests for service interactions
- Current overall coverage: 17.27% (target: 80%)
- Active work on improving test coverage and fixing test issues

## Benefits
- Improved maintainability through separation of concerns
- Easier testing with isolated components
- Better error handling at service boundaries
- Simplified future enhancements
- Comprehensive test coverage tracking
- Automated test suite for continuous integration
- Clear separation of validation, error handling, and business logic
