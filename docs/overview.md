# Trump Tracker Overview

## Data Management Strategy

### Local Database Storage
- FRED economic data is stored in a local SQLite database
- Data is not real-time and updates on different schedules:
  - CPI: Monthly updates
  - Core CPI: Monthly updates
  - Food Price Index: Monthly updates
  - Gas Prices: Weekly updates
  - Housing Price Index: Monthly updates
- Database is used to serve requests instead of making API calls on each visit
- FRED API is only called when new data is available based on update schedule

### Data Update Process
1. Initial data load: Historical data is fetched from FRED API and stored in database
2. Periodic updates:
   - Weekly job for gas prices
   - Monthly job for other metrics
3. All user requests are served from the local database
4. FRED API is only called during scheduled updates

## Project Status

## Project Goals
1. Track and analyze economic metrics during Trump's presidency
2. Provide accurate economic indicators with appropriate update frequencies
3. Compare historical data with current trends
4. Provide AI-powered analysis of economic trends
5. Ensure data accuracy and reliability
6. Make economic data accessible and understandable
