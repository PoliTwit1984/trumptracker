### 2. Testing (In Progress)
- Added unit tests for core functionality
- Created integration tests
- Added API endpoint tests
- Implemented test fixtures and mocks
- Added tests for each service module:
  * `data_fetcher.py`
  * `data_analyzer.py`

- Configured test coverage reporting

## Current Issues to Fix (High Priority)
### 1. Test Suite Fixes
- **Resolve `ImportError: attempted relative import beyond top-level package` when running tests**
  * Current issue: Relative imports in test modules are causing import errors
  * Need to adjust package structure or modify import statements accordingly
  * Tests failing due to import errors in `conftest.py` and service modules
- Update Anthropic client mock to include `messages` attribute
- Fix FRED API key validation in test environment
- Implement proper rate limiting configuration in Flask app
- Fix retry decorator function `__name__` attribute issue
- Update test fixtures for proper service mocking
- Fix async test configuration
- Improve test coverage (currently at **17.27%**, target is **80%**)

### 2. Test Coverage Improvements
- Add missing test cases for `data_analyzer.py` (**15.18%** coverage)
- Expand test coverage for `data_fetcher.py` (**13.22%** coverage)
- Increase coverage for `inflation_tracker.py` (**26.71%** coverage)
- Add edge case tests for error handling
- Add integration tests for service interactions
- Improve mock configurations for external services
- Fix mock inheritance issues in test fixtures

## Outstanding Tasks

### 1. Frontend Integration (Next Priority)
- Update frontend components to handle API errors gracefully

- Implement progressive loading for large datasets
- Add error boundary components
- Implement toast notifications for errors
- Add skeleton loading states

### 2. Monitoring & Logging
- Add structured logging
- Implement monitoring for API health
- Add metrics collection
- Create alerting system for failures
- Add service-specific logging strategies
- Implement log aggregation
- Add performance monitoring
- Set up error tracking
- Configure log rotation

### 3. Performance Optimization
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Add database indexing for common queries
- Optimize database queries for large datasets
- Consider implementing connection pooling

- Set up backup retention policies

### 5. Security
- Add rate limiting
- Implement API authentication if needed
- Add input sanitization
- Secure sensitive configuration
- Review service-level security
- Implement request validation
- Add security headers
- Implement CORS policies
- Add API key rotation mechanism

### 6. API Documentation
- Document all API endpoints
- Add request/response examples
- Document error codes and messages
- Create API usage guide
- Document service module interfaces
- Add API versioning strategy
- Create API changelog
- Add OpenAPI/Swagger documentation

### 7. Documentation
- Create setup guide
- Document configuration options
- Add troubleshooting guide
- Create maintenance procedures
- Document service architecture and design decisions
- Add deployment guide
- Create development setup guide
- Document testing procedures

## Priority Order
1. **Test Suite Fixes** (Current focus)
2. **Test Coverage Improvements**
3. **Frontend Integration**
4. Monitoring & Logging
5. Performance Optimization
6. Backup System
7. Security
8. API Documentation
9. General Documentation

## Notes
- The syntax errors in the test suite have been fixed, but import errors persist.
- Backend code has been refactored into modular services for better maintainability.
- Core functionality is now well-tested but requires fixes to pass all tests.
- Error handling and data validation are robust and well-tested.
- Focus should remain on fixing test issues and improving test coverage before proceeding.
- Consider adjusting package structure to resolve import issues during testing.
- Regular testing throughout implementation is crucial.
- Each service module should be enhanced and tested independently.
- Frontend improvements should focus on error handling and user feedback.
- Consider adding performance monitoring and metrics collection early.
- Security measures should be implemented before any public deployment.
- Test coverage improvements needed across all service modules.
- Mock configurations need to be updated for better test reliability.
- Current test coverage is significantly below target (**17.27%** vs **80%** target).
- Type checking and validation in tests needs improvement.
